# hello-world
So here I am, out in the world and trying new things that require lots of different projects and such so yeah. I'm going to by trying my hand with Github

Hello, my name is Rachel Ormsbee and I like art, design, and nature. It seems a little funny that I would be learning how to use GitHub then, right? Not entirely.

While I find myself in love with the creatie side of life, it never quite satisfies the more organized and methodical side. Thus, I am learning in areas where I am able to combine both hemispheres of my brain to create beautiful but functional works which I hope to someday share with the world.
